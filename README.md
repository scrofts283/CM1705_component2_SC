Using a version control systems is considered best practice for both individual users as well as teams for multiple reasons. 

Version control systems save a complete history of every file. This means the system records each change made by a user over the entire length of the project. Including the creation and deletion of files as well as edits to the file contents. The system will also include information on who made the change, the date and time the change was made and the purpose of each change. 

During the development of a project, if bugs or errors occur, or if data is lost a version control system is a great way to implement fixes quickly minimising any potential disruption. Users can roll back or undo the commits which caused the error easily therefore taking the project to the point before the error occurred. The system can also help the user understand what happened to cause this by allowing the user to easily access and compare the last working file with the file which caused the error, this can decrease the time developers spend trying to identify the cause of a fault.
