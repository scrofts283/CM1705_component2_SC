Using a version control systems is considered best practice for both individual users as well as teams for multiple reasons. 

Version control systems save a complete history of every file. This means the system records each change made by a user over the entire length of the project. Including the creation and deletion of files as well as edits to the file contents. The system will also include information on who made the change, the date and time the change was made and the purpose of each change. 

During the development of a project, if bugs or errors occur, or if data is lost a version control system is a great way to implement fixes quickly minimising any potential disruption. Users can roll back or undo the commits which caused the error easily therefore taking the project to the point before the error occurred. The system can also help the user understand what happened to cause this by allowing the user to easily access and compare the last working file with the file which caused the error, this can decrease the time developers spend trying to identify the cause of a fault. 

Version control systems allow users to create branches which enables the user to keep work independent from other parts of the project. The branch allows the user the opportunity to test out new features or solutions before committing to the project. If the idea doesnâ€™t work the user can delete the branch knowing that the core project will be unaffected. If the ideas do work, the user can merge the new branch into the core project.

Additionally when working within teams using a version control system means that multiple users can easily collaborate on a project ,locally or remotely, by allowing team members access to files simultaneously and view the history of the project.They also offer the ability for multiple users to work on either the same area or different areas of the project without the fear of overwriting each other's work. 

Most version control systems will have an approvals process built into the system allowing teams extra security before a file is updated or pushed to live. Approval processes can allow more senior users or project managers to check the work of other team members therefore decreasing the risk of pushing a project live with errors. 

In conclusion, version control systems help users monitor changes within files therefore maintaining the workflow of the project or team you are working with. They allow developers to make changes to files without worrying that something will get lost or undocumented.  As version control offers a backup and full history of a project / file, If a mistake is made or an error found, the individual or team can turn back the clock on the file to compare earlier versions or fix the mistake all while minimising disruption to the project.
